<description>
  Procman is a tool for managing many processes distributed over one or more
  comptuers.  There are two ways to use procman:

  1) Sheriff / Deputy mode

  In this mode, every workstation runs a bot-procman-deputy process.  One
  workstation runs a bot-procman-sheriff process, which provides a GUI to
  command and communicate with the deputies.

  Using the GUI, you can:
    create new processes
    start, stop, restart processes
    aggregate processes together into logical groups (e.g., "Planning")
    view the standard output of each process (redirected by deputies)
    save and load process configuration files
    view process statistics (memory used, CPU% used)

  2) Lone Ranger mode

  This mode is primarily useful when you only want to run processes on the
  local computer.  In this mode, the sheriff acts as its own deputy.  To
  operate in lone ranger mode, run

  bot-procman-sheriff --lone-ranger

  or with -l, but --lone-ranger is cooler.

  GLib (>= 2.0)
  LCM  (http://lcm.googlecode.com)

  Python
  PyGTK  (bot-procman-sheriff is written in Python with PyGTK)

  Currently only tested on GNU/Linux.  Some stuff will definitely only work on
  Linux (e.g., the process memory, CPU statistics).
