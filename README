This is the code base for libbot2

Overview
========

libbot2 is a collection of several pieces of software (pods).  Some pods
may depend on others.  The current list of pods is:

  bot2-core       C library with some simple but useful routines,
                  and a set of core message types (LCM types).

  bot2-vis        C library of classes and functions for visualizing data
                  with OpenGL and GTK2.

  bot2-lcmgl      Transmitting and rendering OpenGL commands over LCM.

  bot2-procman    Process management tools for controlling many processes 
                  on one or many workstations.

  bot2-lcm-utils  LCM utility programs (tunnel LCM over TCP, chop or splice
                  log files, etc.)

Requirements
============

  These packages are required.
    GLib 2.0+
    CMake
    LCM   (http://lcm.googlecode.com)

  These packages are strongly recommended.  In other words, you should
  install them unless doing so is impossible.
    Java (Sun JDK or OpenJDK strongly preferred, gcj probably will not work)
    Python
    GTK+2.0   (required by bot2-vis)
    OpenGL    (required by bot2-vis)


  On a Debian/Ubuntu system, the following packages should be sufficient:
    libglib2.0-dev
    cmake
    sun-java6-jdk | default-jdk | openjdk-6-jdk
    python-dev
    libgtk2.0-dev
    mesa-common-dev
    libgl1-mesa-dev
    libglu1-mesa-dev
    freeglut3-dev

    Additionally, you'll need to install LCM from http://lcm.googlecode.com

  On OS X, the recommended procedure is to use MacPorts and install:

Installation
============

  By default, this software does not require installation.  Instead, it
  builds and runs from within the build/ subdirectory.

  To compile, run: 

  $ make

  If you want, you can also install it to your system by running:

  $ sudo make BUILD_PREFIX=/usr/local
