<summary>
    Transmit OpenGL commands over LCM, and render them elsewhere.
</summary>

<description>
    bot2-lcmgl contains a aset of client libraries in C, Java, and Python
    for transmitting OpenGL commands over LCM.  It also provides routines
    for receiving and rendering these commands in either a standalone
    application (bot-lcmgl-viewer), or incorporated into another
    C/C++ application.

    A nice attribute of the client libraries is that they do not depend on
    any OpenGL libraries, and only require LCM.
